During the trip we will pass by “El Candelabro”. It’s an impressive figure painted in the sand and its origin (a well as the Nazca lines) is unknown. Around 10H30 transfer to the airport in Pisco. Departing from Pisco, your plane will fly southeast to the Nazca Desert. From your window, you can admire the Nazca Lines in their entirety – an impossible feat for tourists on the ground. Spread out over a plateau, the designs cover 280 square miles (450 km). Seeing the lines from a plane ensures that you’ll get to see a wide variety of these huge designs, the largest of which spans 935 feet (285 m). But these deserts and valleys have histories much older than the Nazca. Over the course of the 1 hour and 35-minute tour, you will pass over the valleys of Ocucaje, Santa Cruz, Palpa, Viscas, and Ingenio. Ocucaje Valley is now recognized as a treasure trove for marine fossils. Over 40 million years ago, the Ocucaje valley was under the sea. Recently archaeologists have discovered the fossilized bones of enormous sea creatures, including the famous 50-foot megalodon shark. Full of sand, dust and high winds, the Ocucaje Valley is not a welcoming place. Viewed from the comfort of an airplane, you will have the chance to survey a landscape that has undergone the most dramatic change possible. This tour allows you to see a huge swath of the Peruvian desert, all in an afternoon. These captains are experienced pilots and know the area extremely well. They steer the plane to make sure you get a good view of the famous glyphs. From a great height, you’ll take in the ancient history and the stunning scenery of the Nazca Desert in one. Afternoon travel back to Lima and transfer to the hotel at the airport in Lima.",
