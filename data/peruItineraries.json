This view is overwhelming, making to our senses to fill with an indescriptible emotion when observing that fabulous view of the Inca City and of the amazing landscape surrounding it. From the Inti Punku it is only 1km more to arrive to the city and enjoy a guided visit to the most important archeological discoveries of recent times. At about 13:00 we will be transported, by bus, from the citadel down to the village of Aguas Calientes where we will enjoy a farewell lunch and afterwards, we go to the train station for our train ride back to Ollantaytambo town where our private car and driver is waiting to transport us back to our hotels in Cusco",

Close to the Temple of the Sun are the Ritual Fountains, Ñusta’s Bedroom and Royal Palace. In the center of the citadel lies the Three-Windowed Temple, part of the central plaza which forms possibly the most spectacular and attractive section of the ruins. The temple’s large windows look east towards the mountains beyond the Urubamba River valley. Next is the Main Temple which boasts stonework even more impressive than the Temple of the Sun.
