Choquequirao is an amazing example of an elite Inca ceremonial center, a city dedicated to worship the “Pachamama”, the Andean mother earth, and “the Apus”, the mountain gods as well as other divinities such as rivers and other nature elements. The various levels of temples, palaces, canals, agricultural areas and aqueducts are fantastic, giving a vivid example of the amazing Inca building techniques. Choquequirao means 'Cradle of Gold' in Quechua and it was in 1710 when the existence of Choquequirao was first mentioned.
