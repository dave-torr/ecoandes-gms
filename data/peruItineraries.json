This view is overwhelming, making to our senses to fill with an indescriptible emotion when observing that fabulous view of the Inca City and of the amazing landscape surrounding it. From the Inti Punku it is only 1km more to arrive to the city and enjoy a guided visit to the most important archeological discoveries of recent times. At about 13:00 we will be transported, by bus, from the citadel down to the village of Aguas Calientes where we will enjoy a farewell lunch and afterwards, we go to the train station for our train ride back to Ollantaytambo town where our private car and driver is waiting to transport us back to our hotels in Cusco",

        "tripDescription":"The Choquequirao, Inca Ruins rival in beauty and importance with the world-famous Machu Picchu although its popularity is not as marked. The complex is located on a high ridge spur at almost 1800 meters of altitude, above the raging glacier-fed Apurimac River, surrounded by the beautiful towering Salcantay and Humantay snow-capped peaks. It was probably built by Tupac Inca Yupanqui, and withstood its ground until after the Spanish invasion in 1532 and during the last days of the Inca Empire during the government of the Inca Pachaqutek, It was finally burned down and left deserted after the execution of the Inca Tupac Amaru I in 1572. Choquequirao is an amazing example of an elite Inca ceremonial center, a city dedicated to worship the “Pachamama”, the Andean mother earth, and “the Apus”, the mountain gods as well as other divinities such as rivers and other nature elements. The various levels of temples, palaces, canals, agricultural areas and aqueducts are fantastic, giving a vivid example of the amazing Inca building techniques. Choquequirao means 'Cradle of Gold' in Quechua and it was in 1710 when the existence of Choquequirao was first mentioned. The first drawings of the structures were made in 1836 by the Frenchmen Léonce Angrand and later by Eugene Sartigues. It was officially rediscovered in the 20th century, where the plaster covering the walls were carbonized and had disappeared for the most part. At the east side of the complex more than 110 terraces with houses and squares are being continuously recuperated. At the west side, another 170 terraces are still hidden and covered by the forest, and in some of these terraces, white colored llamas can be seen in symmetrical order as decorations. Today only 30% of the whole city is recovered from the forest, making Choquequirao the largest and most interesting Inca City in America",

Somehow, it has slipped from view and retains an authenticity like nowhere else in Peru.

Here we find the town of Patacancha with a long-established textile community with strong ancient Quechua traditions, surrounded by stunning scenery. This area is seldom visited by tourists and gives a privileged insight into the lives of the Quechua inhabitants, eager to show their way of life. Departing Patacancha by minibus, we head towards the extensive Inca ruins of Pumamarca which stand sentry on the hillside overlooking the old Inca settlement of Ollantaytambo. Clinging to the hillside, Pumamarca is a remarkably well-preserved Inca fort built to protect the Sacred Valley. Continuing down into Ollantaytambo, we visit the small Inca museum and have time to wander through the delightful streets to see many of the original Inca walls and doorways on which the new town has been built. After lunch, we take the train to Aguas Calientes, the starting point for the next day’s visit to the fabulous lost Inca City of Machu Picchu. Hotel accommodations in Aguas Calientes",
